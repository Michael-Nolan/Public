# 99+ Problems

There is a somewhat famous [99 Prolog](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/) problems list, and a [99 Lisp](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/problemas-lisp/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html) problems list. 

The goal of the problem set is to get someone familiar with the basics of a language. 
The goal is **not** to come up with the most optimal solutions, but to come up with the most **idiomatic** solutions.

## Normal Languages

My professional life mostly involves using "normal" languages like Java, GoLang and Python. 
Normal in this case is synonymous with [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming), [procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming), [mutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)), and having a "C style" syntax. 
Though the industry is clearly moving towards adopting some functional ideas. (Which is a good thing!)

With the above definition of normal, then a language like C or Go would be contenders for the most normal language 


## Out of the norm languages
But there are lots of "different" languages out there. Languages that require different ways of thinking.

* Lisp
* Haskell
* Smalltalk
* Forth
* APL
* Prolog
