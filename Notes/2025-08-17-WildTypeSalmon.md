# First Taste Cultivated Salmon - WildType Foods

[WildType Foods](https://www.wildtypefoods.com) makes cultivated "lab grown" Salmon. The availability is pretty limited. Only a few restaurants have it. Luckily for me one of the restaurants is in Austin TX. [Otoko](https://otokoaustin.com) is a two part restaurant. One half is a 20 course omakase experience. The other half is a cocktail bar. Both halves have the WildType salmon available. 


Cultivated "lab grown" meat is meat that is grown in a lab (think brewery vats). For WildType specifically, they started from cells taken from Pacific Salmon a few years ago. WildType states that they no longer require any animal products to keep their production going.


The WildType salmon was available in two dishes. A sashimi style, and a crudo style. The flavor for both were quite good. It was definitely a salmon flavor. The texture was a bit off, a little gummy or less flaky than traditional salmon, but not bad. The off texture was more noticeable in the sashimi dish, likely due to the cut being long, wide, and thin. The crudo cut was more cube like, and the texture was less noticeable there. I think you could sneak this into a poke bowl, or into a sushi burrito, and few people would be able to notice.


Cost wise, the WildType was a little over double the other options. However, this is not a direct comparison since no other salmon dish was available at the cocktail bar section of the restaurant. I am not sure how much of this cost is due to WildType being more expensive than traditional options, or due to the restaurant charging more since its a novel item. Maybe a mix of both. Portion size wise, the WildType Salmon was similar to other items on the menu.


The staff at Otoko mentioned that very few people at the cocktail bar have ordered the WildType Salmon. They told me that at the omakase side, the WildType comes standard as a part of the 20 course meal and that they have seen mixed reactions from customers with some finding the idea exciting, and others being quite apprehensive. The staff were very interested in knowing if I had already heard of WildType before coming to the restaurant, and they were interested in getting my feedback on the dish. It seems like they are working closely with WildType to provide feedback.


From WildType's [blog](https://www.wildtypefoods.com/news/blog/otoko) the WildType salmon was available starting on July 17th. According to the staff at Otoko the WildType salmon is available until September 1st. The September 1st end date is likely because [SB261](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/history.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=SB261), which takes effect on September 1st,  bans the sale of cultivated meat in the state of Texas. 


It was exciting to try cultivated meat for the first time. The product isn't perfect, but it has a lot going for it. Its better for our oceans and rivers, its mercury free (hurray for pregnant sushi lovers), and it can be produced anywhere regardless of geography. If they can get the cost down, then this has a real chance of competing with wild caught or farm raised salmon.
